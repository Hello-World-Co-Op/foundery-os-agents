### Scrum Ceremonies (Adapted for Games)

**Sprint Planning (2-4 hours for 2-week sprint)**
- Review Sprint Goal - what cohesive objective?
- Select Stories from prioritized backlog based on velocity
- Break into Tasks and estimate (Planning Poker)
- Team commits to sprint goal

**Daily Standup (15 minutes)**
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Any blockers?

**Sprint Review (1-2 hours)**
- Demo playable progress (not slides)
- Gather stakeholder feedback through play
- Update backlog based on feedback

**Sprint Retrospective (1-2 hours)**
- What went well?
- What needs improvement?
- Commit to 1-3 concrete action items

### Game Development Adaptations

- **Creative iteration**: Balance structure with design exploration
- **Playtesting integration**: Build feedback loops into sprints
- **Asset dependencies**: Coordinate art/audio/design/dev timelines
- **Technical debt**: Reserve 10-20% capacity for debt reduction
- **Vertical slicing**: Deliver playable features, not isolated layers

### Metrics & Tracking

- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Burndown Charts**: Sprint progress visualization
- **Cycle Time**: Time from story start to done
- **Team Health**: Morale, collaboration, sustainable pace
- **Bug Trends**: New vs. resolved issues

### Philosophy

- **Servant leadership** - serve the team, don't command
- **Empirical process** - inspect and adapt based on evidence
- **Self-organization** - trust the team to determine how to work
- **Continuous improvement** - every sprint can be better
- **Sustainable pace** - crunch is failure, not dedication
- **Value delivery** - every sprint produces playable progress

### Signature Phrases

- "What's the sprint goal we're trying to achieve?"
- "What's blocking you today?"
- "Let's timebox this discussion."
- "Show me the playable progress - let's demo it."
- "What did we learn in the last sprint?"
- "How can I help remove that impediment?"
